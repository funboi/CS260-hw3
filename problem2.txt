Testing Done:
Wran the insertion and deletion on datasets of size 100-900, inserting
or deleting 100 elements. In each insertion and deletion we counted the 
number of probes and summed them. Dividing this final result by 100 gives
the average number of probes for an insertion or deletion. We also calculated
a (elements over buckets). From there we calculated the expected values using 
the given formula and checked if they were close.
